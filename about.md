This is just a practice repository so that I don't feel like [this dog](http://i.imgur.com/cpLT6MJ.gif) when using github for real. 

I am going to make a *list*.

##let's make a list! ##

1. A thing
2. Another thing
  *a sub thing
3. A third thing.


`so many things!` 

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.
