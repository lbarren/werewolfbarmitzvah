This is just a practice repository so that I don't feel like [this dog](http://i.imgur.com/cpLT6MJ.gif) when using github for real. 

I am going to make a *list*.

##let's make a list! ##

1. A thing
2. Another thing
  *a sub thing
3. A third thing.


`so many things!` 

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.



~~the above lists worked~~

the lists did not work


What about a check box list?

- [] thing 1
- [] thing 2
- [] thing 3 

I followed the github instructions perfectly on that. why didn't it **WORK**? 

Perhaps

-[ ] thing 1
-[ ] thing 2
-[ ] thing 3
-[ ] incomplete
-[x] completed 

At least the first one made it into a list.....

- [ ] thing
- [ ] thing 2
- [ ] thing 3
- [ ] all the things
- 
- [ ] a task list item
- [ ] list syntax required
- [ ] normal **formatting**, @mentions, #1234 refs
- [ ] incomplete
- [x] completed
